# Reactive Extensions talk

This talk was given at [FAIRTIQ](https://fairtiq.ch/) and [Liip](https://www.liip.ch/fr).

It is split in 3 parts: slides to give an overview, a sample of the traditional approach to code UI and the same sample using RxSwift.

* Slides can be found under the [slides](slides) folder. 
  * They are written in Mardown and are generated with [Marp](https://github.com/yhatt/marp/).
* The traditional way of binding UI is in the `traditional` branch
* The reactive way ot binding UI is in the `rxswift` branch
  * Run `pod install` first, then open *RxSwiftTalk.xcworkspace*

For each step of the samples, there are simple commits and tags helping navigate step by step.
